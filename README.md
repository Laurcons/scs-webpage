Hi! Welcome to my homepage.


## Counting
Are you ready to count with everyone on the faculty's server?

Enter `wget -q localhost/~plie3204/counting/install.sh -O - | bash` into your Bash to begin.

Worried about what you're running? The command will download and execute the
[install script](https://scs.ubbcluj.ro/~plie3204/counting/install.sh)
which installs the
[counting client](https://scs.ubbcluj.ro/~plie3204/counting/counting.sh)
for your account.
